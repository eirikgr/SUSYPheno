# SUSYPheno
A program for doing scans of pMSSM models taking into account constraints from various measurements. 
The core code is written by BÃ¸rge Kile Gjelsten and modified/extended by Eirik Gramstad.

## Prerequisites
```
python2.x

```

## First time set up do
```
git clone https://github.com/eirikgr/SUSYPheno.git
cd SUSYPheno
source install.sh
```
## Every time you start a new terminal
```
export SUSYPHENO_PATH=$PWD
export PATH=$PATH:$SUSYPHENO_PATH/bin
```
If you want to enable plotting you would also need to have ROOT installed ([ROOT Download Page](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root))
## How to run the program
In order to do the plotting you will need ROOT (see [ROOT Download Page](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root) on how to install root). You can continue to do the parameter scans, but the plotting will not work if ROOT is not installed.

## Make a first test run
Create a work directory, e.g. `susyscans`, some where on you computer
```
cd susyscans
mkdir scantest1
cd scantest1
```
Then calculate 1 MSSM point (with initial parameters set in the command).
```
signalgrid_loop.py  -fnadd _testgrid1  -mssmloop M1=100:M2=250:mu=400:TB=10:mA=2000 
```

The output is mostly given in so-called tlt-format: the first line shows the quantity name, the second line shows the value (for the given scenario). The output files are as follows (where <pointdesc> is susy_testgrid1_M1_100_M2_250_mu_400_TB_10_mA_2000 for the above example):

```
<pointdesc>_scanvars_all.tlt        : just the variables specified on input line (the ones not taking default values)
<pointdesc>_scanvars_multi.tlt      : similar, but only vars which on input line has more than one value
<pointdesc>_susyhit_slha_mass.tlt   : input vars + all SUSY masses
<pointdesc>_susyhit_slha_extpar.tlt : input vars + ~all Lagrangian parameters
<pointdesc>_susyhit_slha_elweak.tlt : input vars + parameters relevant for elweak sector
<pointdesc>_susyhit_slha_rest.tlt   : input vars + some additional vars (the rest)
<pointdesc>_susyhit_slha_mixing.tlt : input vars + mixing parameters in squark/slepton/neutralino/chargino sector
<pointdesc>_susyhit_errlowtune.tlt  : input vars + errors + finetuning parameters + experimentally constrained vars 
<pointdesc>_susyhit_MO.tlt          : input vars + MicrOmegas output (DarkMatter++, experimentally constrained vars)
<pointdesc>_susyhit_ds.tlt          : input vars + DarkSUSY output (DarkMatter, experimental bounds)
```

To see the above description and some more details on options etc. 
```
signalgrid_loop.py -h 
signalgrid_loop.py --showpmssmpars   : shows the notation for the 24 pmssm parameters
signalgrid_loop.py --showpmssmvals   : shows the default value of the 24 pmssm parameters
```

## Make a first scan
```
cd susyscans
mkdir scantest2
cd scantest2
```
Scan 7x7 in M2 and mu; Set M1,TB (=tan(beta)), mA ; the rest takes default (high values) and are then mostly not relevant at LHC
```
signalgrid_loop.py  -fnadd _testgrid1  -mssmloop M1=100:M2=100,150,200,250,300,350,400:mu=100,150,200,250,300,350,400:TB=10:mA=2000 
```
This takes a few minutes to run and produces for each of 7x7 pMSSM setups some ~16 files. These files contain the relevant output. Ex: Dark matter values are found in the files *_ds.tlt. 
To see the filenames do
```
ls -l *_ds.tlt  
```
To see the file content do 
```
cat *_ds.tlt
```
Make things a bit nicer by lining up and keeping header only on the first line:
```
cat *_ds.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh
```
### Example: Check Dark Matter relic density
Look at the *DMbestVSexp* and see if predictions is
1. above 1: SUSY scenario predicts more DM than observed (i.e model is EXCLUDED). 
2. exactly 1 (within uncertainties): this SUSY scenario will account for all of the Dark Matter we have.  
3. below 1: this SUSY scenario is fine (in this variable), but does not account for all the Dark Matter. (There needs to be additional physics out there to give the rest of the Dark Matter.)

## Plot result of scan (**need ROOT**)

Make nice table of your tlt-files (e.g. from the scan above)
```
cat *_ds.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh > table_ds.txt
```
And check if they look reasonable by inspecting it
```
less table_ds.txt
```
Then make a plot of the SUSY DM relative to experimental value (*DMwCoVSexp*) as a function of the two free parameters (*mu* and *M2*)
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu,M2  -resvars DMwCoVSexp 
```
This produces a pdf-file (*much.pdf*) with your plot.

### More on plotting
Below are some useful options to refine the plot: 
Rename axes
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  
```
Give new title
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  -title 'Dark Matter with coannihilation VS experiment'  
```
Add numbers onto canvas
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  --numbers  
```
Add a countour at 10, as well as changed the colour (to red, 2), the style (to 7) and the width (to 5)
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  -cont DMwCoVSexp::1,10:2:7:5  
```
Specify a meaningful name on the output file
```
cat table_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  -save DarkMatter1.pdf  # specify a meaningful filename
```
To see some of the options in munch.py, type 
```
munch.py -h 
```

## Look at other variables
The table  in the example above only have input from darksusy (ds). You might want to study other variables. In this case it is practical to make some more tables: 
```
cat *_elweak.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh > table_elweak.txt
cat *_masses.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh > table_masses.txt
cat *_errlowtune.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh > table_errlowtune.txt
cat *_MO_mini.tlt | lineup_removeduplicates.sh > table_MO.txt
```
Tables can be combined (horizontally): 
```
paste table_elweak.txt table_ds.txt > table_elweak_ds.txt
```
The above is useful if the variables you want to use are not in the same table. With the combined table you can for instance plot the same as above, but with the chargino mass in contour at 100 GeV
```
cat table_elweak_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  -cont ~C1::100
```
You can also add two contrours (chargino mass in contour at 100 GeV (in red) and *DMwCoVSexp* equals 1 (in green)
```
cat table_elweak_ds.txt | munch.py -coord mu:#mu,M2:M_{2}  -resvars DMwCoVSexp  -cont DMwCoVSexp::1:2:7:5,,~C1::100:3:4:4
```
